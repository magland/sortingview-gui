const text: string = "# Correlogram subsampling\n\nFor efficiency, sortings are subsampled when creating auto- and cross-correlograms.\nSince cross-correlograms make comparisons between different units, the spike trains\nare sampled according to windows of time, rather than sampling firing events--pure\nrandom subsampling of events is not optimal because it is less likely that both\nspikes in an event pair which could appear in the histogram will be part of the\nrandom sample.\n\nEven with time-based sampling, there is a risk of missing pairs of events that\nought to appear in the histogram. In particular, if the sample windows are\nbrief, there is a risk that the window will capture only one-half of a pair of\nfiring events. However, more protracted time samples increase the risk of\ninducing bias toward certain areas of the recording.\n\nThe default sampling strategy strikes a balance between these risks by sampling\nall units in 100 slices of 10 seconds each, resulting in 1000 seconds of observations\nevenly distributed across the duration of the recording. Sampling is only used if\nless than half of the recording would be included in the samples; shorter recordings\nare used in their entirety.\n"
